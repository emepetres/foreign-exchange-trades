# foreign-exchange-trades
Dummy foreign exchange trades web application, based on Django 2.1

NOTES:
* Two decimal precision for trade amounts
* Four decimal precision for trade rate
* MAX trade amount: 99,999,999.99

TODO:
* PRODUCTION/DOCKER


## Deploy

### Standalone
**Requirements** The standalone deployment requires a machine with _python 3_, _pip_ and _virtualenv_, and virtualenv must be accesible by the command `virtualenv3` in the path.

**WARNING:** _DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING_

0. Navigate to _fetrades_ folder
1. Copy _settings.ini.example_ to _settings.ini_ and edit the latter:
	* Set `SECRET_KEY` to an alphanumeric random string
	* Set `DEBUG=False` for production-like environments
	* Set the list of allowed hosts in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, separated by comma.
	* Set `FIXER_API_KEY` to the appropiate _fixer.io_ api key. Get one for free at https://fixer.io/. 
2. Run `./setup.sh`. The script will ask the information to create a new _admin_ user.
3. Run `./up.sh` to run the application on http://localhost:8000.

### Production environment
To Be Done


## Test
In a standalone deployment, use `./test.sh` to run all the tests available. Internally it uses _django.test_ module, a wrapper of _unittest_ module.


## Development
The source code follows the pep8 style guide, using flake8 and pylint as linters.

To make modifications, the standalone deployment is the right one. Use `/setup-dev.sh` instead of `./setup.sh` to install autopep8, flake8 and pylint.

_Suggestions to improve:_
* Validate data again on the server against Fixer.io, before creating the trade.
* Ensure uniqueness in trade Id generation, by checking if the generated id exists in the system.
